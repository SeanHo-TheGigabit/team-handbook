## Know Your Path

### 🎯 Understand Career Trajectories

**Do:**

* Know your options: IC (individual contributor) vs. leadership tracks.
* Identify skills needed at your current and next level.
* Discuss your goals with your supervisor.

**Don't:**

* Drift aimlessly from one task to another.
* Wait for someone to “give” you a growth plan.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "I want to specialize in system architecture. Can we plan projects where I can design backend flows?" \
❌ Bad: "Not sure where I’m heading, just doing tasks."

---

## Take Initiative

### ⚡ Lead Beyond Your Role

**Do:**

* Volunteer for projects outside your regular scope.
* Identify and fix things even if they aren’t your assigned task.
* Mentor others when possible.

**Don't:**

* Limit yourself to assigned tickets.
* Ignore recurring problems or friction points.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "I noticed onboarding confusion. I drafted a wiki to help new devs start faster." \
❌ Bad: "That’s not my job — someone else should do it."

---

## Build Relationships

### 🤝 Collaborate Cross-Functionally

**Do:**

* Get to know people from QA, product, design, DevOps, and business.
* Understand how your work impacts others downstream.

**Don't:**

* Stay isolated within your immediate team.
* Push tasks downstream without context or empathy.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "I synced with product to understand the user journey before writing auth flows." \
❌ Bad: "Didn’t think frontend needed that — I just returned raw data."

---

## Balance Hard and Soft Skills

### 🧠 Grow in More Than Just Code

**Do:**

* Improve in areas like technical writing, estimation, and team influence.
* Practice public speaking in demos or retros.

**Don't:**

* Only focus on languages, tools, and code.
* Avoid presenting your work or ideas.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "I documented our caching strategy and presented it in team sync." \
❌ Bad: "I wrote it all, but didn’t explain to others how to use it."

---

## Use All Available Resources

### 🧰 Get Help and Keep Learning

**Do:**

* Ask supervisors for feedback, career advice, or mentoring support.
* Use tools like ChatGPT, Udemy, or YouTube to self-learn.
* Bookmark internal docs, Notion pages, or post-mortems.

**Don't:**

* Rely on annual reviews for improvement.
* Ignore blockers in your personal growth.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "Struggled with estimation — asked for help in retro and got a template to improve." \
❌ Bad: "Never seem to hit estimates, but not sure what to do about it."

## Final Reminders

* You own your career — take control.
* Growth = effort + feedback + learning + contribution.
* Leadership isn’t a title — it’s a habit.
* Help others grow, and growth will come to you.
