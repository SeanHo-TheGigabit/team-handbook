# Team Culture and Expectations

## Purpose of This Guide

This document sets clear expectations for how we work as a tech team. It helps new and current members align with our values, communication style, and approach to work. It’s not just a list of rules — it’s a playbook for doing meaningful work, growing as a professional, and building a high-trust, high-output culture.

## Core Values

### 1. Clear Expectations

* Know what "done" looks like before starting a task.
* Understand deadlines, stakeholder needs, and testing requirements.
* Communicate early if anything is unclear — don’t make assumptions.

**Example:**

> Before starting on the "checkout redesign", clarify: does it include mobile views? Do we support guest checkout? What’s the launch date?

### 2. Culture of Responsibility

* You are responsible for the outcome, not just the effort.
* Be the driver of your task — follow up, chase blockers, and close the loop.
* Ask yourself: “What’s the next step?” and act on it.

**Example:**

> Instead of saying “I’m waiting for the API,” ask who’s responsible, ping them, and offer to help with documentation or mock data in the meantime.

### 3. Encourage Growth

* Growth comes from challenge, reflection, and feedback.
* Don’t just fix bugs — learn from them.
* Make your work easier next time: automate, document, template.

**Example:**

> After struggling with a timezone bug, document the learning in Confluence or a README to prevent future issues.

## Professional Mindset

### Communicate Clearly

**Do:**

* Give structured updates: `[Task] – Status – ETA – Blockers`
* Include what you’ve done, what’s next, and what you need help with.
* Use async updates in Slack or project tools when possible.

**Don’t:**

* Send vague messages like “still working on it.”
* Wait until a meeting to raise issues.
* Expect others to chase you for updates.

### Example:

✅ Good: `"[Invoice Bug] In Review – ETA: Today EOD – Blocked by frontend validation spec"` \
❌ Bad: `"Still working on invoices"`

---

### Show Ownership

**Do:**

* Own your deliverables end-to-end.
* Solve problems instead of passing them on.
* Think: “What else might break?” and test accordingly.

**Don’t:**

* Ignore quality to “just get it done.”
* Depend entirely on QA to find issues.
* Wait for a PM to follow up on missing tasks.

### Example:

✅ Good: `"The form fix is deployed. I also added a test to prevent regression."` \
❌ Bad: `"Done. Let me know if anything breaks."`

---

### Keep Improving

**Do:**

* Look back after each task: what worked, what didn’t?
* Ask for code review even when not required.
* Read, reflect, and bring ideas to the team.

**Don’t:**

* Repeat mistakes without asking why.
* Get defensive about feedback.
* Assume your current way is the best way.

### Example: 

✅ Good: `"I noticed we repeated a lot of logic — I’ll refactor that in the next sprint."` \
❌ Bad: `"That’s how I’ve always done it."`

---

## Do’s and Don’ts by Practice

### 🧠 Initiative & Planning

**Do:**

* Break down the task before coding.
* Identify unknowns early and plan around them.
* Share risk areas with the team.

**Don’t:**

* Dive in without understanding the goal.
* Rely on back-and-forth to surface blockers.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: `"To finish this by Friday, I’ll need the final asset pack by Wednesday."`

---

### 🔄 Task Updates

**Do:**

* Post daily updates, especially during critical phases.
* Log updates in project management tools or Slack.

**Don’t:**

* Stay quiet for days.
* Wait until delivery to share status.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: `"Completed validations. Starting integration. ETA: Friday."` \
❌ Bad: `"Just working on it."`

---

### 💬 Communication & Meetings

**Do:**

* Prepare your talking points in advance.
* Ask focused questions, propose solutions.
* Follow up with notes or action items.

**Don’t:**

* Use meetings to "catch up" instead of preparing.
* Speak without purpose or direction.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: `"I need a decision on API versioning before EOD so I can proceed."` \
❌ Bad: `"I'm just here to see what others are doing."`

---

### 🤝 Team Collaboration

**Do:**

* Offer help when you’ve got bandwidth.
* Mentor juniors or document common pitfalls.

**Don’t:**

* Work in isolation or hoard knowledge.
* Avoid team discussions to “just focus.”

**Example:** \
✅ Good: `"I documented how to use our deploy script – shared it in #dev-resources."` \
❌ Bad: `"Oh yeah, I figured it out last week but didn’t share."`

---

## Final Reminders

* Be proactive, not reactive.
* Aim for impact, not busyness.
* Communicate clearly, especially under pressure.
* Help others succeed, and the team wins together.

This guide is a living document and will evolve as our team grows. Let’s keep improving — together.
