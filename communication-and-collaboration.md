# Communication and Collaboration

## Purpose

This guide focuses on effective communication habits and collaborative practices that help teams work faster, solve problems together, and reduce misunderstandings. Clear communication is not optional — it's how we build trust, unblock work, and scale our knowledge.

## Asking Questions Professionally

### 🧠 Ask Early, Not Late

**Do:**

* Ask as soon as you're blocked or unsure.
* Frame the question with what you've tried and what you're trying to do.

**Don't:**

* Wait hours or days hoping to "figure it out yourself" when you're stuck.
* Ask questions without showing any effort or context.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "I'm integrating the payment API, but I’m getting a 403. I’ve double-checked the token header — anything else I should check?" \
❌ Bad: "Payment not working. Help?"

---

### 🧩 Provide Context

**Do:**

* Share what you're trying to achieve.
* Mention steps already taken and where exactly you're stuck.

**Don't:**

* Say only “it’s not working.”
* Assume the other person knows your current code or setup.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "I followed the docs for endpoint /v1/orders, added headers, but I’m getting a 422 — here's the payload." \
❌ Bad: "API broken again."

## Collaborating Across Teams

### 🤝 Pair Up to Solve Faster

**Do:**

* Reach out to frontend/backend/design/QA early when integration is needed.
* Share test credentials, mock data, or tools.

**Don't:**

* Wait until last minute to align.
* Work in silos when features span multiple teams.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "I’ll coordinate with QA this week for test coverage before release." \
❌ Bad: "Didn’t know QA needed staging access."

---

### 📚 Share Knowledge

**Do:**

* Document common issues and workarounds.
* Share useful links, scripts, or findings.
* Use internal wiki, Slack channels, or code comments.

**Don't:**

* Keep fixes in personal notes.
* Answer the same questions repeatedly without documenting.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "Created a Notion page for Git rebase strategies — linked in #dev-howto." \
❌ Bad: "Oh yeah, I fixed that last month but didn’t write it down."

---

## Tools & Channels

### 💬 Use the Right Channel

**Do:**

* Use Slack for async updates and follow-ups.
* Use project tools (Jira, Notion, Linear) for task status.
* Use calls when something needs fast resolution.

**Don't:**

* Bury blockers or decisions in DMs.
* Use meetings for information that could’ve been written.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "Posted blocker in thread and linked ticket for tracking." \
❌ Bad: "Only told John privately — rest of the team didn’t know."

---

## Meeting Discipline

### 📅 Come Prepared

**Do:**

* Know the agenda or your talking points.
* Share updates clearly and briefly.

**Don't:**

* Join without context or reason.
* Use meetings to figure out your update on the spot.

**Example:** \
✅ Good: "Completed endpoint work, now blocked on frontend review — need final approval." \
❌ Bad: "I don’t have much today. Just listening."

---

## Final Reminders

* Ask early, and ask with context.
* Use shared tools and open channels to keep knowledge accessible.
* Respect others’ time by being prepared and focused.
* Collaboration is not optional — it's how great teams win.

This guide pairs with task management and culture documents — review it anytime you feel unsure about when or how to communicate.
